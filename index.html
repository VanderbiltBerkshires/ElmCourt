            <h2>Elm Court Amendment: Preserving Tomorrow</h2>

            <h3>Echoes of the Past: The Vanderbilt Vision That Shaped Elm Court</h3>
            <p>Imagine 1886: The air hums with the promise of endless summers. Emily Vanderbilt Sloane, niece of the legendary Cornelius Vanderbilt, commissions architects Peabody & Stearns to craft a shingle-style masterpiece—a 55,000-square-foot Manor House blending rustic charm with unparalleled luxury. Flanked by Frederick Law Olmsted's masterful landscape design, the estate unfolds like a living tapestry: rolling lawns, whispering woodlands, and the serene Lilly Pond, a haven for family gatherings, lavish balls, and quiet reflection.</p>
            <p>For over a century, Elm Court has whispered tales of innovation and indulgence—the Vanderbilts' bold fusion of nature and architecture that defined America's Gilded Age. It was a sanctuary where fortunes were made in conversation, and legacies were etched into the Berkshires' soul. Today, we honor that heritage not as a relic, but as the foundation for tomorrow.</p>
